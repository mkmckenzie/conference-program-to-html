He recently completed design of an interception barrier to allow continued operation of a landfill that has elevated temperatures from exothermic reactions. In addition to heat transport, he has evaluated groundwater transport of contaminants and migration of landfill gas. He was the originator of the concept of landfill gas rather than leachate as the source of volatile organic compounds in groundwater and has obtained regulatory approval for natural attenuation of landfill gas impacts on groundwater in California and for groundwater contaminants ranging from coal ash constituents to uranium in various other states.
