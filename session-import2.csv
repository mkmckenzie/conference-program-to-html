Meanwhile, feed manufacturers are searching for sustainable alternatives to traditional protein sources. A sustainable insect farming operation near Vancouver, British Columbia, grows black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) as a renewable source of nutrients for animals and plants. The larvae are reared on pre-consumer recycled food collected from local farms, food processors and grocery stores. After harvesting, the larvae are processed into high value protein and oil commodities as sustainable substitutes for costly and resource-intensive ingredients like fishmeal and palm kernel oil. The larvae manure is a natural fertilizer that can be used in organic crop production.

These projects offer an opportunity to use spare capacity in existing infrastructure to divert material from landfills. In many cases, a wastewater treatment plant will have spare digester capacity to accept food waste, but not spare power generation capacity to use additional biogas generated from the food waste.<br> <br> This presentation will provide an overview of options for using biogas at wastewater treatment plants. These options are somewhat different than those for landfill gas projects, largely because of high electrical consumption in the wastewater treatment process. The presentation will cover technical, commercial and regulatory aspects of energy use.

Progressive companies are forming innovative cross-sector partnerships, adopting zero waste to landfill policies, and taking the lead on influencing policy. The U.S. EPA is promoting resource efficiency and sustainable materials management. Local governments, as always, are looking to manage waste in an economic and environmentally sustainable manner. But real barriers remain, such as struggling markets for secondary recovered materials and the difficulty in bringing innovative technologies to the market. In this session, you will hear about what it will take to move from a linear economy to a circular economy and how you can help foster this transition. <br> <br> ",4/6/16 8:30,4/6/16 9:30,Ballroom C,all, ,"TMichaels,AYeckel,MHammond,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/ImplementingTheParadigmShiftTransitioningtoaCircularEconomyinNorthAmerica.aspx,KITPSTtaCEiNA040616all040616830AMIntroduction to SWANA's Technical Divisions, <br> <strong> ABSTRACT:</strong><br> A great way to get more out of your SWANA membership is to join one of SWANA‰Ûªs seven Technical Divisions.

But, the unique nature of landfill decomposition and the demands of safety, environmental compliance and energy recovery create a dynamic environment under which the system has to perform. These conditions place long-term stresses on system components and increasingly challenge the ability of operators to effectively and efficiently manage the collection and control of LFG in a cost effective manner. We will present a case study of the I-95 Landfill, located in northern Virginia, where due to an aging system, operation and maintenance had become onerous and expensive. As a result, Fairfax County moved forward with a plan to evaluate, redesign and rebuild the system with the intention to simplify operation and optimize performance while reducing lifecycle operation and maintenance costs.

Flooding of LFG extraction wells can severely limit the LFG production potential of wells. By dewatering wells, more of the accumulation slots can be exposed, leading to increases in LFG extraction rates. <br> <br> Description: Flooding of landfill gas wells is an all too common occurrence. Liquid blockage of the well slots and flooding of the surrounding waste can lead to a reduction in LFG generation, increase in surface emissions and reduction in revenue for reuse systems. The need for LFG well dewatering is obvious; the solution may not be obvious. With the ongoing moderation in energy prices, any increase in LFG production helps a project‰Ûªs financials. Vendors manufacture many types and capacities of LFG well dewatering pumps. However, all of these pumps have one simple, but restraining trait ‰ÛÒ they require some form of motive power. Running electrical or compressed air lines to well locations across the entire surface of even a medium sized landfill can be a costly investment. By eliminating the need for these services, many more wells can be dewatered, and LFG flows from each well can be increased. One highly successful means of powering LFG well pumps comes from directly above the landfill ‰ÛÒ the limitless energy provided by the sun! Recently, the power from the sun has been harnessed to power LFG well pumps with absolutely no need for electrical or compressed air lines to each well. Without the umbilical of electric or compressed air lines, moving pumps from well to well can increase the effectiveness of the dewatering system while reducing the number of pumps needed for a landfill. This presentation will show how these modestly priced and highly effective systems can be used for virtually any LFG well dewatering application and how they can be easily moved for increased total site dewatering efficiency. Documented increases in LFG production due to well pumping will be presented.<br> <br> Following this presentation, participants will be able to...<br> 1) 1ddress extraction well flooding issues<br> 2) 2elect pumps for well dewatering<br> 3) quantify increases in LFG production due to dewatering ",4/6/16 12:30,4/6/16 13:30,Ballroom C,LGB, ,"JCurro,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/WellDewateringPumpsPoweredbytheSunIncreaseLFGProduction.aspx,LCSDPPbtSILPMCS040616LGB0406161230PMPre/Post LFG Treatment:Biogas Conditioning: New Technologies,"<strong> ABSTRACT:</strong><br> Biogas conditioning systems for use in co-generation equipment and vehicle fuel systems have been common place at landfills for many years.

HDR, currently providing long-term engineering services to the SWMD, was retained to develop a stabilization plan for the sinkhole area, address potential impacts the sinkhole had to the landfill operations, and develop remediation plans for repairs to the landfill infrastructure that was damaged by the collapse. Since a sinkhole collapse directly within a landfill disposal footprint is an extremely rare occurrence, there were no established methodologies in place for the remediation and environmental protection of the stabilization. HDR, working closely with the SWMD and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Solid Waste Management Division, developed a thorough plan addressing: the initial stabilization of the sinkhole collapse area, investigation and characterization of the sinkhole geology, a remediation plan for sealing the sinkhole cavity, and repair, reuse, of the impacted disposal area.

These sites are part of the city‰Ûªs waste management facilities, providing treatment and disposal of MSW for almost 50 years. For the most part, solid waste disposal at these sites has been based on shallow dry-tomb landfilling with average waste depths of about 15 to 20 meters. The development of LFG collection and utilization projects was undertaken voluntarily at two of the sites (East Calgary and Shepard) in 2005. The dry nature of the MSW, combined with the dry climate, shallow nature of the waste landfills and changes in regulatory requirements, have presented challenges to extract and maintain consistent sustainable LFG flow rates and stable gas quality. The recovered LFG at each site always has been significantly lower than modeled LFG, even with using the lowest default factors for methane generation constant and methane generation potential. This low generation also makes it extremely difficult to maximize the beneficial end use of the gas using the designed power generation equipment at these two waste management facilities. The LFG facilities were designed, operated and maintained by CH2M through a consultancy agreement with the city since the start of operations in 2005.

Difficulties with the Ontario approvals process will be discussed, as well as broader difficulties, including the sensitivity of energy prices and utility incentive programs on the economic viability of such projects. The importance of non-economic drivers will be reinforced.<br> <br> Description:<br> The City of Kawartha Lakes (CKL) is a municipality located in Central Ontario, Canada, with a population of 75,000. The City owns and operates five landfills, the largest of which is the Lindsay/Ops Landfill located north of the Town of Lindsay. There are currently 900,000 tonnes of waste in place, with a total capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes. In June 2008, modifications were made to Ontario waste management regulations to address greenhouse gas emissions from landfill gas As a result, it became a requirement for any operating landfill site with a total waste capacity greater than 1.5 million cubic metres to implement landfill gas control. The Lindsay/Ops Landfill fell into this category, and in 2008, CKL applied for funding through the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC). CKL was successful in obtaining two-thirds funding for a landfill gas collection, flaring and utilization project. A detailed design was completed, and the flaring and collection system were tendered in advance of the landfill gas utilization component. The landfill gas flare and collection system was constructed during 2011 and has been operational since March 2012, flaring on the order of 115 cfm of landfill gas at 42 percent by volume methane. The landfill gas utilization component of the project was anticipated to involve a landfill gas fuelled engine that would provide electricity for both the landfill and the adjacent Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Based on the amount of landfill gas available, a 335-kilowatt engine was specified, which closely matches the load at both facilities. This project was tendered in September 2011. When pricing was received, it was higher than anticipated and the economics of the project were re-evaluated. Recommendations were made to City Council not to proceed with the landfill gas utilization component of this project; however, City Council overturned this and called for further measures to be taken to reduce cost and move this green energy project forward. In 2012, (as a cost-saving measure) CKL purchased a 335-kilowatt engine directly that would be supplied to a successful contractor to install. The project was re-tendered in this format, and construction began in October 2014. Construction was completed during July 2015, and connection to the electricity grid was scheduled for August 26th, 2015. The project has been plagued by challenges including the following:<br> ‰Û¢	timing constraints due to funding deadlines imposed by the MOECC <br> ‰Û¢	approval processes that have significantly changed since the beginning of the project (i.e. the Ontario Renewable Energy Approval process). <br> ‰Û¢	the sensitivity of the project‰Ûªs rate of return given current energy prices and available incentive programs. <br> ‰Û¢	lack of submitted tenders and tender prices in excess of expectations. <br> ‰Û¢	limited economy of scale with respect to landfill gas pre-treatment for small electricity generation projects. <br> The challenges listed are interconnected and affect either the timing of the project and/or the overall economic viability. Despite these very significant challenges, CKL continued to push this project forward and now looks forward to producing enough green power to operate their facilities.<br> <br> Following this presentation, participants will be able to...<br> 1) understand the difficulties of implementing a small landfill gas to energy project.<br> 2) understand the sensitivity of energy prices and utility incentive programs on the bottom line.<br> 3) understand the importance of non-economic drivers for these types of projects.<br> ",4/6/16 14:30,4/6/16 16:00,Ballroom C,LGB, ,"DKerr,DBurgess,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/TrialsandTribulationsofaSmallLandfillGastoEnergyProject.aspx,ILAoaSLGtEP3KoGP040616LGB040616230PMSession Change,.,4/6/16 15:30,4/6/16 15:40,.,RTZW, ,,,SC040616RTZW040616330PMBest Hope is Not Hoping for the Best:  Critical Legal Issues in Waste Collection Contracts,<strong> ABSTRACT:</strong><br> <br> Attendees will learn to identify and shape key contract provisions to minimize risk and liability and maximize performance from service providers in municipal contracts for residential and commercial franchised collection. ,4/6/16 15:40,4/6/16 16:10,Ballroom B,RTZW, ,"BShanoff,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/CriticalLegalIssuesinWasteCollectionContracts.aspx,BHiNHftBCLIiWCC040616RTZW040616340PMSession Change,.,4/6/16 16:00,4/6/16 16:10,.,"LF,LGB", ,,,SC040616LFLGB040616400PMSession Change,.,4/6/16 16:10,4/6/16 16:20,.,RTZW, ,,,SC040616RTZW040616410PMLeachate Techniques through Case Studies,"<em>In a rapid-fire and lively discussion of various case studies for leachate management, we will hear from presenters using case studies to describe a leachate management system.

Production capability was not fully used, and additional LFG was flared. The district negotiated a contract with its waste collection contractor to purchase BioCNG fuel. The agreement allowed the contractor to purchase a new CNG fleet and the district to develop the first satellite CNG fueling outpost supplied by a transport trailer filled at its primary (landfill) location.<br> <br> Description<br> St. Landry Parish Solid Waste District installed a BioCNG biogas processing system in 2012 to make compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle fuel for municipal vehicles, including Sheriff's Department cars, light duty trucks and a light duty van, and the solid waste district‰Ûªs utility trucks. The award winning project came about due to the district‰Ûªs 2008 decision to invest in a landfill gas (LFG) collection and flaring system to market greenhouse gas (GHG) offsets. That successful voluntary project provided an opportunity to find a beneficial use for the gas. After evaluating the potential beneficial uses for the collected LFG, the dDistrict deemed the biogas-to-vehicle fuel project to be the most economical choice. The SW District continued to expand its CNG vehicle fleet. As a result of the growing fleet, coupled with their history of fueling, the district worked on plans to expand its fueling capacity contemplating further growth in the use of biogas as a vehicle fuel. The best way to economically grow the BioCNG program was to increase CNG fuel demand. Parish residents embraced the original fueling concept, and some of the local communities have expressed a desire to have the BioCNG vehicle fuel available at a convenient off site location. However, this fuel demand alone would not allow the district to expand the system. The district did recognize Progressive Waste Solutions, the Parish‰Ûªs solid waste hauler, as a potential CNG user, but all of the existing vehicles were diesel powered. Due to hard work and diligence by the district, a mutually beneficial agreement was reached with Progressive for that company to convert its waste hauling fleet to CNG and commit to purchase a satisfactory volume of landfill derived CNG. One requirement of the CNG purchase agreement was for the district to have an un-interruptible CNG supply for the trucks. Adding backup natural gas to the landfill‰Ûªs BioCNG fueling station was not an option due to the distance to the nearest pipeline. The district decided to install an off-site CNG fueling station (satellite site) that would be supplied by the use of a CNG tube trailer filled at the landfill fueling station (primary site). The satellite site would have backup natural gas in the event that BioCNG was not available. This primary/satellite system also provides an off-site BioCNG source in the most populated Parish community and will be made available to the general public. This is the first development of a primary/satellite mobile fueling station that utilizes biogas derived CNG as the primary fuel source.<br> <br> Following this presentation, participants will be able to...<br> 1) understand economic and physical considerations for expansion of the BioCNG processing facility<br> 2) create a win ‰ÛÒ win solution in developing a CNG vehicle fuel demand<br> 3) understand logistics of providing BioCNG fuel to a remote location <br> ",4/6/16 16:10,4/6/16 17:40,Ballroom C,LGB, ,"SWittman,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/StLandryParishBioCNGGoesMobilewithaSatelliteRenewableNaturalGasFuelingOutpost.aspx,SaULPBGMwaSRNGFO040616LGB040616410PMSafety and Utilization:Onsite Leachate Destruction by Utilizing Landfill Gas and Leachate Evaporator Technology," <br> <strong> ABSTRACT:</strong><br> Summary<br> An ongoing problem that exists in many landfills throughout the country is the disposal of landfill leachate. Many landfills are running out of options of what to do with this ongoing issue and are turning to leachate evaporation that utilized landfill gas as a fuel source to evaporate the volumes that once were having to be hauled to local treatment facilities.<br> <br> Description<br> The development and implementation of the Subtitle D rules in the mid-1990s have dramatically improved waste handling and disposal practices in the United States. These regulations have improved human health and the environment where waste management intersects with our lives. Significant reductions in contamination of ground water and air quality, as well as disease carrying vectors and nuisance odors are attributable to improved design, construction, and operation of landfills under Subtitle D. These regulations also have presented challenges related to the costs of these operations. Not the least of these is related to leachate management. Collecting, storing and disposing of leachate in an environmentally responsible manner can be very burdensome and costly to the operation of a Subtitle D landfill. This presentation discusses problems encountered by one Subtitle D facility in South Carolina, one in Alabama and how they are reviewing the technology that was utilized on a Subtitle D facility in North Carolina that had similar problems. We will discuss the process of evaluating the various solutions that these sites investigated, judging both economic and technical feasibility criteria. Attempts to partner with local municipalities to extend service to the landfill were made, and programs including recirculation and pump/haul disposal were implemented at various times or not allowed. While each of these approaches showed promise at times, economic and other issues also presented new problems to be dealt with. This led the facility in North Carolina to explore a program it had evaluated previously; leachate evaporation. The landfill engaged in conversations with a third-party developer/operator of leachate evaporators. These conversations quickly turned into negotiations for turn-key management of a leachate evaporator with a capacity of 34,000 gallons per day using landfill gas as its sole source of fuel. Several steps went into the project, from both solid waste and air permitting modifications, agreement negotiation, to evaluation of existing leachate quality, design of the evaporation facility, management of residual material, operator selection and training, and startup. This project has been running continuously and steadily for more than three years now. Future plans are for possible expansion of the project using techniques currently under development to capture waste heat from landfill gas to power generators currently installed and operating. Just recently, the site in North Carolina has conducted additional testing on the particular matter that is generated in the evaporation process which is then discharged to the atmosphere and the findings also are discussed in the presentation.<br> <br> Following this presentation, participants will be able to...<br> 1) see how at one time the problem with disposal of leachate on their landfills can now be destroyed safely and cost efffectively by utilizing a resource that they are producing already on the landfill. <br> ",4/6/16 16:10,4/6/16 17:40,Ballroom C,LGB, ,"RKeckler,DPepper,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/OnsiteLeachateDestructionbyUtilizingLandfillGasandLeachateEvaporatorTechnology.aspx,SaULDbULGaLET040616LGB040616410PMOvercoming Roadblocks to Zero Waste:Building Processing Capacity for Food Waste Diversion,<strong> ABSTRACT:</strong><br> Coming Soon ,4/6/16 16:20,4/6/16 17:30,Ballroom B,RTZW, ,"VRoof,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/BuildingProcessingCapacityforFoodWasteDiversion.aspx,ORtZWPCfFWD040616RTZW040616420PMOvercoming Roadblocks to Zero Waste:Herding Cats-Getting People to Work Together,"<strong> ABSTRACT:</strong><br> This presentation will demonstrate what long-term strategic planning, historically prudent financial management, utilization of existing infrastructure, beneficial timing, a dedicated appointed Board of Directors and some visionary staff leadership can bring about with a focus on creating a true ""Zero Waste"" facility.<br> Starting in 2010, the Monterey Regional Waste Management District realized the need to plan for the next generation of its recycling system. State legislation and regulatory agencies made clear a statewide 75% recycling goal. In 2014, the District‰Ûªs debt from its 1996 MRF would be paid off and the MRF would require upgrades. In 2015, the franchise agreements in seven of its member communities would expire. The key to success was to work regionally to develop a unified vision while respecting the unique character and needs of each community. The District engaged HF&amp;H Consultants to work with the District and member communities to define the goals and the methods for achieving them, including: 1) new infrastructure to support processing of all waste, recycling, organics, and C&amp;D in the region; 2) recovery of energy and fuel products; 3) competitive procurement for franchise collection services; and, 4) a business model that aligns with a future with less waste.

However the tools available for collection system management often require intensive manual labor and are limited in capability. This presentation demonstrates equipment developed for remote, real-time monitoring of key gas parameters (CH4%, CO2%, O2%, Temp., Pressure and Flow Rate) at the wellhead, as well as for remotely adjusting static pressure of those wellheads. This work also demonstrates the feasibility of automated control in a way that can be scaled with site size and needs.<br> åÊ<br> By using the described equipment, unprecedented frequency and granularity of data collection has been achieved. This data is visualized through a web portal accessible from anywhere. Identification of well flooding is shown, as is correlated behavior in adjacent wellheads. This collected data can be used in future work to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of gas generation and sub-surface movement, and process sensitivities to factors such as rainfall, atmospheric pressure, or system vacuum.<br> åÊ<br> By developing equipment capable of continuous monitoring of key gas production variables, coupled with control capability using a remotely actuated valve, this work has enabled new levels of control over the gas collection system.

These funds now represent the start of a project at the Santiago Canyon Landfill, where methane is currently being flared. In the coming months, Ener-Core will install a 333 kW ecostation that will directly convert the low-Btu methane to electricity at the landfill, as part of a new partnership between Ener-Core, the County of Orange, and APEP. This project will not only benefit the local community, but it will represent a big shift at a global level, as there are hundreds of closed landfills around the world that currently emit greenhouse gases. Although the project won‰Ûªt start generating electricity until 2017, Ener-Core‰Ûªs Power Oxidizer is planned to provide approximately $250,000/year worth of electricity to the county. <br> <br> <br> ",4/7/16 11:10,4/7/16 11:30,Ballroom C,LMOP, ,"ACastro,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/ProductivelyTurningLandfillGasintoCleanRenewableEnergy.aspx,LWTLGiCRE040716LMOP0407161110AMLMOP Workshop:Utilizing a Combustor and a Waste Heat Generator to Convert Landfill Gas to Clean Power," <br> <strong> ABSTRACT:</strong><br> Mr. Miller will illustrate and define all of the components that make up the complete system; i.e., the combustor, the exhaust gas heat exchanger, the waste heat generator and all related piping and wiring. He will provide complete installed cost breakdowns of the system item by item and compare the installed costs of a combustor/waste heat generator system with those of Internal combustion engine gen set running on methane gas. Also, he will compare the annual operating costs of the combustor system to those of the internal combustion engine system. The presentation will compare the life cycle of both systems and discuss the emissions from both systems. <br> <br> <br> ",4/7/16 11:30,4/7/16 11:50,Ballroom C,LMOP, ,"RMiller,",https://swana.org/Events/SWANApalooza/ConferenceProgram/2016/UtilizingaCombustorandaWasteHeatGeneratortoConvertLandfillGastoCleanPower.aspx,LWaCaaWHGtCLGtCP040716LMOP0407161130AMLMOP Workshop:Questions,.,4/7/16 11:50,4/7/16 12:00,Ballroom C,LMOP, ,,,LW040716LMOP0407161150AMBees Ferry Road Landfill Facility Tour,"Charleston County's Environmental Management Department operates the 312-acre Bees Ferry Road Landfill, including a 36-acre Compost Facility that processes 100% of the yard waste generated and accepted at the landfill, nearly 75,000 tons a year. Charleston County has become the largest compost producer in the state and one of the largest on the East Coast. The facility has implemented two major innovations _ using compost as Alternative Daily Cover and conducting a food waste composting pilot.

This is somewhat different than most Landfill Gas to Energy projects in that BCWS decided to keep the carbon credits rather than allow the end user of the LFG to collect them. Google was the first company to purchase carbon credits from BCWS. &nbsp;A section of the landfill is closed using artificial turf - specifically the &quot;Closure Turf&quot; manufactured by AgruAmerica. This system was designed to handle up to 2,500 Standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) of LFG of which they were able to produce around 300 SCFM allowing for expansion over the next 10 years using up to 6, 2 megawatt generators. Future projects include plans to take the leachate and effluent from the landfill and wastewater treatment facility and use it in an algae to energy facility.<br />Tour Guide: Mark Schlievert, Director of Solid Waste - Berkeley County<br />Sponsored by Watershed<img alt=""Watershed"" class=""sponsors"" style=""width: 35%;"" src=""/portals/0/events/sponsors/watershed.jpg"" />",4/7/16 13:00,4/7/16 16:30,.,all, ,,,BCWST040716all040716100PM
