This is somewhat different than most Landfill Gas to Energy projects in that BCWS decided to keep the carbon credits rather than allow the end user of the LFG to collect them. Google was the first company to purchase carbon credits from BCWS. &nbsp;A section of the landfill is closed using artificial turf - specifically the &quot;Closure Turf&quot; manufactured by AgruAmerica. This system was designed to handle up to 2,500 Standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) of LFG of which they were able to produce around 300 SCFM allowing for expansion over the next 10 years using up to 6, 2 megawatt generators. Future projects include plans to take the leachate and effluent from the landfill and wastewater treatment facility and use it in an algae to energy facility.<br />Tour Guide: Mark Schlievert, Director of Solid Waste - Berkeley County<br /><p>Sponsored by Watershed</p><img alt=""Watershed"" class=""sponsors"" style=""width: 35%;"" src=""/portals/0/events/sponsors/watershed.jpg"" />",all,#,.
